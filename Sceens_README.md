Hello,

This readme is designed to help the next group of deveolpers with the management of screens.

All screens that currently exist are in need of production. All screens aside from the chat_screen.dart are static.

The users_events_screen.dart events and date static thus the need to be dynamic. They also need to be connected to the database. Think of these screens as templates to avoid constructing an entire page.
